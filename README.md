# A-Perfect-Find
Unity / Oculus game

# NOTE:
This project is outdated and was mostly an experimentation. I used it to learn Unity and Oculus Development in it's early stages.

I would suggest looking at the images to get a rough idea of what it was like. You were given a specific amount of time to find a certain object that matched the same colour as the one displayed on the podium. I tried to design the game so it would utilize rotating your head and looking around the environment, since it was one of the new opportunities the Oculus created.

I'm fairly sure you can't run this project since it was made on such an outdated version of Unity, and to be fair, it's not super mind blowing. But still an interesting project for experience / learning.
